                <p xml:id="p-4">Parliaments represent the main fora for political debate that shapes
                    legislation which directly impacts our everyday lives. Parliamentary discourse
                    is motivated by a wide range of communicative roles and reveals patterns of
                    political agendas, ideological stances and institutional roles of members of
                    parliament who represent the interests of citizens (<ref target="#Ilie.2017"
                        >Ilie, 2017</ref>). This is also why parliaments have always been of
                    interest to scholars from a range of disciplines in the humanities and social
                    science.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-5">Parliamentary proceedings are being increasingly made available in a
                    digitized form, and turned into structured linguistic resources called corpora
                    for many European languages. These are often available online and can be queried
                    through dedicated tools called concordancers. Researchers use these to perform
                    diverse linguistic, stylistic, cultural, societal and political studies (<ref
                        target="#Biel.2018">Biel et al., 2018</ref>; <ref target="#Jaworska.2018"
                        >Jaworska and Ryan, 2018</ref>). </p>
                <p xml:id="p-6">While corpus methods are widely used in linguistics (<ref
                        target="#Biber.2015">Biber and Reppen, 2015</ref>; <ref
                        target="#McEnery.2011">McEnery and Hardie, 2011</ref>), including gender
                    analysis (<ref target="#Baker.2014">Baker, 2014</ref>), this tutorial shows the
                    potential of richly annotated language corpora for research of the
                    socio-cultural context and changes over time that are reflected through language
                    use. The tutorial encourages students and scholars of modern languages, as well
                    as users from other fields of digital humanities and social sciences who are
                    interested in the study of socio-cultural phenomena through language, to engage
                    with user-friendly digital tools for the analysis of large text collections. The
                    tutorial is designed in a way that takes full advantage of both linguistic
                    annotations and the available speaker and text metadata to formulate powerful
                    quantitative queries that are then further extended with manual qualitative
                    analysis in order to ensure adequate framing and interpretation of the
                    results.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-7">The tutorial demonstrates the potential of parliamentary corpora
                    research via concordancers without the need for programming skills. No prior
                    experience in using language corpora and corpus querying tools is required in
                    order to follow this tutorial. While the same analysis could be carried out on
                    any parliamentary corpus with similar annotations and metadata, in this tutorial
                    we will use the <ref target="http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1300">siParl 2.0
                        corpus</ref> which contains parliamentary debates of the National Assembly
                    of the Republic of Slovenia from 1990 to 2018, although knowledge of Slovenian
                    is not required to follow the tutorial. To try out the analyses in other
                    languages, we invite you to explore a parliamentary corpus of your choice from
                    those <ref target="introduction">available through CLARIN</ref>.</p>

                    analysis, followed by an introduction of the characteristics of specialized

                    gender. The second part of the tutorial is a hands-on, which demonstrates the
                    potential of some of the best-known corpus analysis techniques, such as
                    concordances, frequency lists, keywords and collocations, to explore the topics
                    female MPs debate in in the Slovenian Parliament over time and to compare and

                    corpus contains richer and cleaner speaker and session metadata which makes it
                    possible to distinguish between MPs and other speakers. In addition, speeches
                    have been labelled with parliamentary terms, which simplifies comparative
                    analysis across different legislative periods. Furthermore, additional
                    linguistic annotation layers, such as Universal Dependency features, syntactic
                    parses and named entities, have also been added to the corpus, but since these
                    will not be used in this tutorial, we do not elaborate on them further. </p>

                    section 6 , since the following three sections (, and ) are dedicated to a
                    general theoretical overview and an introduction to the basic terminology. Even
                    though you can follow the tasks in section 6 without studying these three
                    introductory sections, we strongly encourage you to do so before finishing this
                    tutorial. They will give you the necessary theoretical foundations that will
                    ensure a comprehensive understanding and independent use of the demonstrated
                    analytical procedures and adequate interpretation of the results.</p>

                            corpora</ref> are large collections of carefully selected
                        machine-readable language data which can be used as the basis of linguistic
                        descriptions or as a means of verifying hypotheses about a language.
                        However, corpora are much more than just simple collections of texts in
                        electronic form. They are formatted in one of the standard formats, such as
                        the Extensible Markup Language or <ref
                            target="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/">XML</ref>, and encoded according
                        to a predetermined but usually flexible schema for the representation of
                        texts in digital form. One of the most established encoding methods in
                        linguistics and digital humanities is the Text Encoding Initiative, or <ref
                            target="https://tei-c.org/">TEI</ref>.</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-15">The basic unit in the corpus is the <ref
                            target="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/token/">token</ref>, the
                        output of an automatic tokenization process which separates a raw text into
                        smaller units, in our case words. The most common way of forming tokens is
                        based on space between the words as a delimiter. Texts in corpora are
                        linguistically annotated to facilitate corpus searches. The two most basic
                        forms of linguistic annotation are <ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging"
                            >part-of-speech tagging</ref>, which marks up the words in running texts
                        with their part-of-speech, and <ref

                        tokens (word forms). Lemmatization is especially important for corpora of
                        morphologically rich languages, such as Slovenian, while less needed for
                        weakly inflective languages, such as English. In addition to linguistic
                        annotation, corpora are also enriched with metadata about the text (e.g.,
                        date, type) and speakers (e.g., name, gender) that are needed for the
                        contextualization of the search results but can also be used for more
                        fine-grained corpus queries. </p>

                <p xml:id="p-19">Parliamentary corpora are of different sizes and contain data of
                    different modalities (written, spoken, gestural) and time periods in one or
                    multiple languages. Although parliamentary debates are mainly provided as
                    written texts (e.g., <ref
                        target="https://repository.clarin.dk/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12115/8"

                    audio/video recordings coupled with corresponding transcriptions (e.g., <ref

                    of linguistic and societal change over time. Most parliamentary corpora have

                    political affiliation, institutional role) which offer valuable insights into
                    the context on the studied phenomenon (see <ref target="#Alasuutari.2018"

                    <p xml:id="p-20">Parliaments are institutions governed by specific rules and
                        conventions (see for example <ref target="https://erskinemay.parliament.uk/"
                            >Erskine May</ref>, a description of the UK parliamentary procedure).
                        These are shaped by sociohistorical traditions that influence the
                        organization and operation of the parliament and also extend to language
                        use, such as conventions for turn-taking or forms of address. These
                        conventions, however, are not necessarily shared among different
                        parliaments; e.g., interruptions are strictly prohibited in the Greek
                        Parliament, whereas in the UK Parliament these are common and often not
                        sanctioned (<ref target="#Ilie.2017">Ilie, 2017</ref>), which needs to be
                        taken into consideration when forming queries or interpreting the results.

                        history and across countries. Editing usually involves elimination of some
                        typical characteristics of spoken language but may also include other
                        interventions, such as the elimination of obvious language or factual
                        errors, dialectal or colloquial expressions, and rude and obscene language.
                        Editing guidelines are mostly not made public, which can substantially
                        hinder research (for more source criticism, see <ref target="#Mollin.2007"
                            >Mollin, 2007</ref>; <ref target="#Rix.2014">Rix, 2014</ref>).
                        Furthermore, speeches by MPs are often, although not in all parliamentary
                        traditions and all types of parliamentary sessions (interpellations,
                        debates, question time, etc.) prepared in advance (i.e.
                        written-to-be-spoken), which has a big impact on their stylistic features.
                        These peculiarities together with the broader sociohistorical context always
                        need to be taken into account when defining research questions, methodology

                    focus of much research in sociolinguistics, stylistics, rhetoric, gender
                    studies, media studies and discourse analysis (see <ref target="#Eckert.2013"

                        (<ref target="#Newman.2008">Newman et al., 2008</ref>). Despite this,
                    political communication studies have traditionally been based on male
                    politicians, and only recently have scholars begun to consider the discourse of
                    female politicians (see <ref target="#Marshall.2000">Marshall, 2000</ref>). </p>
                <p xml:id="p-25">This is important because several authors (<ref

                    female legislators differ from their male counterparts in the issues they
                    address, the positions they take, and the approaches they use in law-making. In
                    their analysis of the representation of women in the UK Parliament after 1945,
                        <ref target="#Blaxill.2016">Blaxill and Beelen (2016)</ref> showed a
                    stronger emphasis on the topics related to women in speeches delivered by female
                    MPs, who on average also contributed considerably more speeches about women in
                    comparison to male MPs. In political science (see <ref target="#Osborn.2012"
                        >Osborn, 2012</ref>), topics related to women are considered those that are,
                    on the one hand, traditionally believed to be in the domain of women (for
                    example, education, healthcare, etc.), and on the other that concern women’s
                    well-being directly (for example, childcare, domestic violence, equality, etc.).
                    Similarly, <ref target="#Bäck.2014">Bäck et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref

                    parliamentary speeches from Sweden, Denmark and Ghana, respectively, that women
                    more often spoke about soft policy areas in comparison to men who more often
                    tackled hard policy areas. This terminology is adopted from political science
                    (e.g., <ref target="#Wängnerud.1996">Wängnerud, 1996</ref>), where policy areas
                    are divided into so-called hard (e.g., Macroeconomics, Energy, Transportation,
                    Banking, Finance and Domestic Commerce, Space, Science and Technology, and
                    Communications) and soft ones (e.g., Health, Labour, Employment and Immigration,
                    Education, and Social Welfare). </p>
                <p xml:id="p-26">We should note, however, that various parameters (e.g., social
                    class, context, age, hierarchy) have been shown to influence language use and
                    that gender is only one of them (<ref target="#Coates.1997">Coates, 1997</ref>;
                        <ref target="#Litosseliti.2006">Litosseliti, 2006</ref>). Furthermore, as
                    Bing and <ref target="#Bing.1998">Bergvall (1998)</ref> point out, similarities
                    in language use of different genders are often overlooked despite being more

                    jump to quick conclusions and over-interpret the results for the features we
                    expect to see because we know the gender of the speaker (<ref

                        states and has seen dramatic changes in gender equality in the past 30
                        years. While in 1986 when Slovenia was still part of the Federal Socialist
                        Republic of Yugoslavia, female MPs represented almost a quarter of all MPs,
                        in 1992 when the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia was convened
                        for the first time, this share notably significantly, so that only in ten
                        MPs was female (<ref target="#AntićGaber.2017">Selišnik and Antić Gaber,
                            2017</ref>). During the transition process, when social, political,
                        economic and value systems changed fundamentally, women in Slovenia lost
                        more of the economic and social gains of socialism than men, and were almost
                        completely ousted from key political institutions. But in the seventh
                        parliamentary term (1/8/2014-21/6/2018), which is the last one included in
                        the siParl 2.0 corpus, female MPs held just over 40% of the seats, largely
                        due to legislative measures enforcing gender quotas. <note place="foot"

                                90). This share is slightly higher than reported in our analysis for
                                which we strictly took only the corpus data throughout the tutorial.
                                Since all of the elected MPs rarely serve the whole term, they are
                                then replaced by other MPs. This is reflected in the corpus which
                                includes all MPs, not just the ones listed at the time of the
                                elections. According to corpus data, the total number of MPs per

                            female MPs in Term1 who collectively uttered more than 3,500 speeches,
                            with just under one million tokens. On average, this is almost 260
                            speeches or 69,000 tokens per MP. However, the contribution per MP is
                            very uneven, ranging from nearly 700 speeches, or more than 170,000
                            tokens, to fewer than 40 speeches comprising around 9,000 tokens. </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-48">Measured in speeches, the first-ranking speaker is Danica
                            Simšič, a member of the Democratic Party of Slovenia, a small opposition
                            party who was elected to the Parliament only in the first term and
                            contributed 680 speeches, or almost 19% of all the speeches in the
                            entire subcorpus, which is almost three times the female average. The
                            share of the speeches by Danica Simšič was calculated by dividing the
                            number of her speeches by the number of all the speeches by female MPs
                            (see Figure 4, left: <hi rend="italic">Total frequency</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Simšič, Danica</hi>). The ratio with regard to the
                            average was calculated by dividing the number of speeches by Danica
                            Simšič with the average number of all speeches by female MPs, which we
                            get by dividing the total number of speeches by female MPs with the
                            number of all female MPs (see Figure 4, left: <hi rend="italic">Total

                        <p xml:id="p-49">Measured in tokens, the female MP with the largest
                            contribution in this subcorpus is Metka Karner Lukač, member of the
                            Slovenian People’s Party, the oldest party in Slovenia, who gave
                            speeches with 173,067 tokens or 18% of the entire subcorpus, nearly
                            three times the average. The MP with the lowest number of speeches as
                            well as tokens is Mihaela Logar, a member of the Slovenian People’s
                            Party, who spoke 39 times and gave speeches with just over 9,000 tokens
                            in her four-year term as MP, which is nearly 20 times less than the
                            first-ranking speaker. It is interesting to note that approximately half
                            of all contributions can be attributed to only three MPs: the two
                            mentioned above and to Breda Pečan, member of the Social Democrats,
                            whose speeches on average were also the longest. This information can be
                            extracted from data on the average length of speeches for individual
                            MPs, which we get by dividing the total number of tokens for the
                            individual MP (see Figure 4, right) with the total number of speeches by
                            this particular MP (see Figure 4, left).</p>

                            female MPs gradually increases along with the number of female MPs in
                            the Parliament. A notable leap in the representation of women can be
                            observed in the last two terms covered by siParl 2.0, which is most
                            probably due to the adoption of gender quotas, according to which, since
                            2011, 35% of the candidates must be women (<ref
                                target="#AntićGaber.2017">Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017</ref>).
                            Importantly, despite quotas being one of the most successful measures to
                            increase the number of female MPs (<ref target="#AntićGaber.2017"
                                >Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017</ref>), our corpus analysis shows a
                            large discrepancy between the number of female speakers and the amount
                            of tokens in their speeches. While election results are easily
                            accessible and frequently used by researchers and analysts, the amount
                            and content of the speeches has been much less readily available and
                            studied much less comprehensively outside corpus linguistics, which is a
                            gap we aim to help close with this tutorial. By looking into the created
                            subcorpora, we can see that for female MPs there is a clear tendency to
                            contribute a lower share of content than would be expected given their
                            share of speakers. This is especially true for Term2 where they produced
                            two times fewer tokens than would correspond to their speaker share. In
                            fact, only in Term4 was women’s contribution marginally greater than
                            their share of seats in the Parliament. Therefore, we can conclude that
                            having more elected female MPs does not directly mean that their voice
                            is more present in the National Assembly. Nonetheless, as the number of
                            female speakers in the Parliament has been on the rise in recent years,
                            the number of their speeches has started increasing as well. From as
                            little as a tenth of all the speeches given in the Parliament during the
                            first five parliamentary terms by female MPs, the contribution of female
                            MPs has risen to almost a third in the last two parliamentary terms
                            covered by our corpus. </p>

                    <p xml:id="p-52">Studies of female political discourse have shown that women
                        tend to debate different topics to men. More about the impact of gender on
                        language can be found in the section 5 .</p>
                    <p xml:id="p-53">In Task 2, we are interested in comparing the topics discussed
                        by female MPs in siParl 2.0 with those discussed by their male counterparts.
                        While topic classification is readily available for some parliamentary
                        corpora, as in <ref target="#Nanni.2018">Nanni et al. (2018)</ref>, this is
                        not the case for siParl 2.0. Topic classification could be derived
                        automatically, as in <ref target="#Karan.2016">Karan et al. (2016)</ref>,
                        however, the goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the potential of
                        parliamentary corpora research via concordancers without requiring
                        programming skills, which is why we opt for a two-step manual approach.
                        Moreover, manual approaches are especially appropriate for highly specific
                        topic classification tasks such as ours, for which no pre-trained models or
                        training data exist. It should be noted that both automatic and manual
                        annotation approaches produce errors, but that we can avoid those due to
                        annotator’s subjectivity by employing multiple annotators. The final quality
                        of such manual annotations can be verified with statistical tests that
                        report on the <ref

                            focus corpus. The focus corpus is the corpus or subcorpus under
                            investigation. The reference corpus is typically a large representative
                            corpus of a given language but can also be any other corpus or subcorpus
                            we wish to use as the reference for comparison. In this task, we will
                            contrast the female-male pairs of the siParl 2.0 subcorpora to uncover
                            the most prominent issues discussed by the MPs in the Slovenian

                        <p xml:id="p-62">In Term1, the majority (54%) of all the analysed female
                            keywords belong to only two topics (<hi rend="italic">Health</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Labour, family and social affairs</hi>), whereas
                            the two most common topics of male MPs with a similar share (55%) are
                                <hi rend="italic">Infrastructure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Public
                                administration</hi>. In Term7, the two prevailing female topics not
                            only remained the same but also slightly intensified (58%) while for
                            male MPs the most prominent topic became <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                affairs.</hi> While the division of topics between genders cannot be
                            explained through simple corpus analysis, both an intense focus on <hi
                                rend="italic">Health</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Social affairs</hi>
                            in the female subcorpora, as well as the shift from <hi rend="italic"
                                >Infrastructure </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Public administration
                            </hi>to <hi rend="italic">Foreign affairs</hi> in the male subcorpora
                            are a good reflection of the state of affairs. At the time of
                            independence, the new-born state of Slovenia had to create its own
                            public administration and re-build its infrastructure, which required
                            intensive discussions in the first parliamentary term. The last term, on
                            the other hand, was marked by more intensive international trade as well
                            as greater international security threats, which warranted legislative
                            and budgetary decisions in the parliament. The intensified discussions
                            on <hi rend="italic">Health issues</hi> as well as a continued focus on
                                <hi rend="italic">Social issues</hi> in Term7 were largely due to
                            heavy pressure on the budget due to the severe economic crisis in that
                            period, which also negatively impacted the already crumbling public
                            health system. </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-63">We can also observe that in Term1, men and women attached
                            similar importance (according to the share of the analysed keywords) to
                            more topics than in Term7 (five shared topics with equal importance in
                            Term1 vs. three topics in Term7). Thus, in Term1, men debated slightly
                            more than women on <hi rend="italic">Public administration</hi> (M: 14%
                            vs. F: 11%), <hi rend="italic">Economy and technology</hi> (M: 8% vs. F:
                            6%) and <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi> (M: 2% vs. F: 1%), and women
                            debated slightly more on <hi rend="italic">Agriculture, forestry and
                                food</hi> (M: 3%, F: 4%), while MPs of both genders debated equally
                            on <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> (1%). In Term7, on the other hand,
                            only three topics appear as equally important to male and female MPs:
                                <hi rend="italic">Finance</hi> (4%), <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi>
                            (3%) and <hi rend="italic">Public administration</hi> (3%). For a more
                            in-depth analysis, it may be interesting to look into the specific ways
                            (if any) in which female and male MPs approach and discuss the key
                            issues of these topics.</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-64">The data shows that female-specific topics are <hi
                                rend="italic">Education </hi>in Term1, and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Health</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Labour, family and social
                                affairs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Culture</hi> in Term7. It is
                            surprising that these last three topics, which are the top three for
                            women, do not appear on the list of topics for men, while we can find
                            the top topics for men (<hi rend="italic">Infrastructure, Public
                                administration, Foreign affairs</hi>) on the women’s list (although
                            with a negligible share of the total). Male-specific topics, on the
                            other hand, are <hi rend="italic">Environment </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Interior </hi>in both parliamentary terms, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Foreign affairs</hi> (in Term1) and <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi>
                            (in Term7). Surprisingly, it can be observed that <hi rend="italic"
                                >Economy and technology</hi>, which is a topic present in both terms
                            for both genders, drastically loses its saliency in the subcorpus of
                            female speeches in Term7. </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-65">Apart from the different areas of interest, the results
                            also show that male and female MPs have different debating styles. In
                            both terms, male MPs use considerably more stylistic words (i.e.,
                            clearly colloquial or jargon words observed only from specific speakers)
                            than their female counterparts. In fact, the usage of such words by male
                            MPs tripled in Term7 compared to Term1, which on the one hand indicates
                            the greater casualness of male MPs in general, as well as highlights a
                            change in the debating culture, which in the last two decades has become
                            more ludic and informal. We also observe that ideological words, which
                            tend to be polarizing, are only used by the male MPs. This is in line
                            with findings from the literature, according to which men’s
                            conversational strategies are more aggressive and competitive, whereas
                            women’s debating style is more cooperative (<ref target="#Coates.1997"
                                >Coates, 1997</ref>). It should be noted that these results would
                            need to be confirmed by a more detailed analysis, since some recent
                            studies have challenged the clear-cut gender difference in debating
                            styles as being an overgeneralization (cf. <ref target="#Ilie.2013"
                                >Ilie, 2013</ref>). </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-66">Our findings point out notable differences in the roles and
                            interests of male and female MPs which is in line with previous studies
                            showing that women focus more on the so-called soft topics than men.
                            Diachronic comparisons reveal that <hi rend="italic">Health</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Social issues</hi> remain the top priority for female
                            MPs, while the focus of male MPs shifted from <hi rend="italic"
                                >Infrastructure </hi>and<hi rend="italic"> Public administration
                            </hi>towards <hi rend="italic">Foreign affairs. </hi>In Term1, the most
                            prominent common topic was <hi rend="italic">Public administration</hi>,
                            while in Term7, <hi rend="italic">Finance</hi> became the most often
                            discussed topic for both male and female MPs. This, however, does not
                            mean that female MPs now debate more on the hard topics, quite the
                            contrary, in fact, as our analysis showed that in Term7 women focused
                            more on soft topics than in Term1.</p>

                    <p xml:id="p-67">This task is inspired by related work (see <ref
                            target="#Blaxill.2016">Blaxill and Beelen, 2016</ref>) which
                        investigated how frequently, by whom and in what way are topics related to
                        women, such as women’s rights, equality, discrimination, etc., addressed in
                        parliamentary history. It is interesting that the impact of gender seems to
                        be prominent even in countries with high representation of women in
                        parliament, such as Sweden, for which <ref target="#Bäck.2014">Bäck et al.
                            (2014)</ref> found that female MPs discuss the so-called hard policy
                        issues less frequently. Furthermore, <ref target="#AntićGaber.2003">Antić
                            Gaber and Ilonszki (2003)</ref> state that society usually expects women
                        MPs to be actively involved in different policy areas than men, in those
                        that are particularly salient to women because of women’s historic role in
                        society or because those areas directly affect women’s lives. </p>
                    <p xml:id="p-68">Given that debates about gender equality are still dominated by
                        issues pertaining to women’s unequal and special role in society, which
                        directly impacts their rights as well as discriminatory practices, we are
                        interested in Task 3 in comparing how male and female MPs in the Slovenian
                        Parliament express themselves when addressing topics related to women by
                        focusing on their use of the noun “ženska/female” as an explicit indicator
                        of debate on such topics.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-69">First, we are interested in how frequently the lemma of the
                            noun “ženska/female” is mentioned by male and female MPs in different
                            time periods (1992-2018). We query all the subcorpora and record all the
                            frequency counts of the lemma in a spreadsheet, with the results shown
                            in Table 6. Because we are interested in comparing subcorpora of
                            different sizes, it is important to use <ref
                                target="http://www.thegrammarlab.com/?p=160">normalized
                                frequencies</ref> instead of the absolute ones, as these raw
                            frequencies can be misleading. Looking for example at the raw
                            frequencies for Term2 (F: 190; M: 794), we could conclude that male MPs
                            mention the noun “ženska/female” four times more often than their female
                            counterparts. But, because the female subcorpus in that parliamentary
                            term is much smaller than the male subcorpus, the normalized frequency,
                            which calculates the frequency based on the same number of words in each
                            subcorpus (in our case a million words), shows that the noun is actually
                            five times more frequent in the female subcorpus (249.29) compared to
                            the male one (50.36). </p>

                        <p xml:id="p-72">Overall, the normalized frequency of the word for the
                            entire time period is nearly five times higher in the subcorpus of
                            female MPs compared to their male counterparts (221.21 vs. 45.99). As
                            can be seen from Figure 10, female MPs in general tend to talk more
                            about women than their male counterparts. However, if the period between
                            Term2 and Term4 (1996–2008) saw a strong emphasis on topics about women
                            among female MPs in comparison to male MPs, we can observe a steep
                            downward turn in the female subcorpus in more recent terms. </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-73">The most striking results for the female subcorpus are
                            observed in Term3 and Term5. In Term3, the normalized frequency of the
                            word reached a record high, which might be a consequence of lower
                            numbers of female representatives in the previous two parliamentary
                            terms and their unequal position in society overall. However, as the
                            same trend is observed in the male subcorpus, it appears that other
                            reasons had to contribute to this result as well. For a better insight
                            into the phenomenon we perform qualitative analysis by inspecting 50
                            concordance lines for the five most active male MPs. They show that
                            legislation regulating specific issues which are particularly linked to
                            women was extensively debated at the time (i.e. legislation related to
                            equal opportunities, artificial insemination with biomedical assistance
                            and quotas). Almost a decade later, in Term5, there was a sudden
                            reduction in the number of mentions of the word in the female subcorpus,
                            which even dropped below the frequency before the year 2000 despite a
                            higher number of female MPs. Term5 coincides with the period of a major
                            global economic crisis, which badly hit Slovenia and probably took
                            centre-stage in parliamentary discussions, but this would need to be
                            confirmed through further investigation and contextualization using
                            qualitative methods, such as concordance analysis.</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-74">It is also interesting to observe that in Term4 despite
                            there being the second lowest number of female MPs, the noun
                            “ženska/female” remains very frequent as opposed to in Term6 and Term7,
                            when the number of female MPs was considerably higher but the
                            frequencies of the queried word almost two times lower. As previously
                            observed in the overall production of female MPs (see 6.2.3 ), where we
                            found a large discrepancy between the number of female speakers and the
                            amount of words they uttered, these results again show that a higher
                            number of female MPs does not guarantee a strong discussion of issues
                            related to women in the Slovenian Parliament.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-84">It can also be observed that the female subcorpus contains
                            comparable representation of all but one thematic cluster which together
                            cover almost 60% of the collocations. The only exception is the cluster
                                <hi rend="italic">Women’s agency and empowerment</hi>. Collocations
                            that belong to this thematic cluster are approximately twice less
                            frequent than collocations belonging to any other cluster. In the male
                            subcorpus, on the other hand, the majority of collocations (61%) fall
                            under only three thematic clusters, namely <hi rend="italic">Problems
                                and violence, Politics, representation and equality, </hi>and <hi
                                rend="italic">Women’s agency and empowerment.</hi> Furthermore, a
                            detailed look into annotations reveals that men mainly focus on women’s
                            social status (e.g., “poročen/married”) and problems (e.g.,
                            “zatiranje/oppression”), as well as their agency and empowerment (e.g.,
                            “sposoben/capable”), while not focusing on issues related to women’s
                            employment and health. On the other hand, collocations from the female
                            subcorpus first and foremost refer to health issues (e.g.,
                            “zdrav/healthy”) and measures related to help and protection (e.g.,
                            “omogočati/enabling”). These are closely followed by words referring to
                            women’s social status (e.g., “izobrazba/education”) and violence (e.g.,
                            “posiljen/raped”), which is again contrary to the male subcorpus where
                            more emphasis is given to problems not directly linked to violence
                            (e.g., “poniževanje/humiliation”). In addition, similar to the male
                            subcorpus, employment-related words do not appear in the female
                            subcorpus among the top 100 collocation candidates.</p>
                        <p xml:id="p-85">These results indicate that female MPs try to address the
                            multitude of issues that women face in various areas of life, from
                            health related issues to the aggression suffered by women and
                            difficulties with entering into politics, while male MPs focus more
                            intensely on the unequal place of women in society and view women as
                            active participants in the process of change. These results also confirm
                            the findings of <ref target="#AntićGaber.2003">Antić Gaber and Ilonszki
                                (2003)</ref> who looked at a shorter period (1996–2004) of female
                            MPs’ activity in the Slovenian Parliament and showed with diverse,
                            non-corpus linguistic methods that there exists a clear difference
                            between the legislative priorities of male and female MPs, identifying
                            similar topics to those in our analysis. </p>
                        <p xml:id="p-86">Our final observation pertains to the high number of
                            grammatical words found in the female subcorpus, which are almost four
                            times more frequent than in the male subcorpus. These collocation
                            candidates in the female subcorpus mainly consists of adverbs, followed
                            by prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and numerals, while in the male
                            subcorpus they predominantly include numerals. Similar to what we saw in
                            the keyword analysis (see 6.3.3 ), this once more points to a different

                            has been found that women tend to employ more language features such as
                            hedges, politer forms and tag questions (<ref target="#Coates.1997"
                                >Coates, 1997</ref>), more intensifiers and adjectives, especially
                            evaluative ones (<ref target="#Poynton.1989">Poynton, 1989</ref>) and
                            more personal pronouns than men, whose language includes more numbers,

                <p xml:id="p-87">The aim of this tutorial was to demonstrate the potential of
                    linguistic corpora and corpus analysis techniques for the analysis of
                    socio-cultural phenomena and trends observed through language use in specialized
                    discourse. We have shown how methods of corpus linguistics enable quantitative
                    as well as qualitative observations that go beyond the researcher’s intuition,
                    and thus offer greater transparency, objectivity, reliability and replicability,
                    which are also becoming increasingly important in data-driven humanities and
                    social science research.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-88">The contribution of this tutorial is three-fold. First, we have
                    demonstrated the importance of understanding the content and structure of a
                    research dataset in order to be able to maximize its potential for our research.
                    Second, we have showcased how a set of standard corpus analysis techniques can
                    be utilized well beyond quantification only and simple corpus queries. Instead,
                    we have systematically used the output provided by the concordancer as a
                    starting point for a detailed qualitative manual analysis that carefully
                    situates the results in the relevant socio-linguistic context. Last but not
                    least, we have situated the tutorial in a real-life research setting,
                    demonstrating the application of common corpus analysis techniques to tackle a
                    set of trending research questions in humanities and social science
                    research.</p>
                <p xml:id="p-89">While the tutorial is based on the corpus of Slovenian
                    parliamentary debates, students and scholars are strongly encouraged to
                    replicate the analyses using parliamentary corpora for other languages, thereby
                    contributing to the multilingual, trans-national and trans-cultural comparative
                    research on parliamentary discourse. </p>
