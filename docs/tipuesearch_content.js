The two most basic forms of linguistic annotation are part-of-speech tagging , which marks up the words in running texts with their part-of-speech, and lemmatization , which is the assignment of a base form or lemma to tokens (word forms). Lemmatization is especially important for corpora of morphologically rich languages, such as Slovenian, while less needed for weakly inflective languages, such as English.

In their analysis of the representation of women in the UK Parliament after 1945, Blaxill and Beelen (2016) showed a stronger emphasis on the topics related to women in speeches delivered by female MPs, who on average also contributed considerably more speeches about women in comparison to male MPs. In political science (see Osborn, 2012 ), topics related to women are considered those that are, on the one hand, traditionally believed to be in the domain of women (for example, education, healthcare, etc.), and on the other that concern women’s well-being directly (for example, childcare, domestic violence, equality, etc.). Similarly, Bäck et al. (2014) , Hansen et al. (2018) and Mensah and Wood (2018) found in the corpora of parliamentary speeches from Sweden, Denmark and Ghana, respectively, that women more often spoke about soft policy areas in comparison to men who more often tackled hard policy areas. This terminology is adopted from political science (e.g., Wängnerud, 1996 ), where policy areas are divided into so-called hard (e.g., Macroeconomics, Energy, Transportation, Banking, Finance and Domestic Commerce, Space, Science and Technology, and Communications) and soft ones (e.g., Health, Labour, Employment and Immigration, Education, and Social Welfare).", "tags": "", "url": "ch3.html#p-25" },

Slovenia is one of the youngest EU member states and has seen dramatic changes in gender equality in the past 30 years. While in 1986 when Slovenia was still part of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, female MPs represented almost a quarter of all MPs, in 1992 when the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia was convened for the first time, this share notably significantly, so that only in ten MPs was female ( Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017 ). During the transition process, when social, political, economic and value systems changed fundamentally, women in Slovenia lost more of the economic and social gains of socialism than men, and were almost completely ousted from key political institutions. But in the seventh parliamentary term (1/8/2014-21/6/2018), which is the last one included in the siParl 2.0 corpus, female MPs held just over 40% of the seats, largely due to legislative measures enforcing gender quotas. The share is based on the official number of all female MPs listed in Kustec (2017) and then divided by the number of all MPs (i.e., 90). This share is slightly higher than reported in our analysis for which we strictly took only the corpus data throughout the tutorial. Since all of the elected MPs rarely serve the whole term, they are then replaced by other MPs. This is reflected in the corpus which includes all MPs, not just the ones listed at the time of the elections. According to corpus data, the total number of MPs per term is thus greater than 90.

A notable leap in the representation of women can be observed in the last two terms covered by siParl 2.0, which is most probably due to the adoption of gender quotas, according to which, since 2011, 35% of the candidates must be women ( Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017 ). Importantly, despite quotas being one of the most successful measures to increase the number of female MPs ( Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017 ), our corpus analysis shows a large discrepancy between the number of female speakers and the amount of tokens in their speeches. While election results are easily accessible and frequently used by researchers and analysts, the amount and content of the speeches has been much less readily available and studied much less comprehensively outside corpus linguistics, which is a gap we aim to help close with this tutorial. By looking into the created subcorpora, we can see that for female MPs there is a clear tendency to contribute a lower share of content than would be expected given their share of speakers. This is especially true for Term2 where they produced two times fewer tokens than would correspond to their speaker share. In fact, only in Term4 was women’s contribution marginally greater than their share of seats in the Parliament. Therefore, we can conclude that having more elected female MPs does not directly mean that their voice is more present in the National Assembly. Nonetheless, as the number of female speakers in the Parliament has been on the rise in recent years, the number of their speeches has started increasing as well. From as little as a tenth of all the speeches given in the Parliament during the first five parliamentary terms by female MPs, the contribution of female MPs has risen to almost a third in the last two parliamentary terms covered by our corpus.", "tags": "", "url": "ch4.html#p-51" },

But, because the female subcorpus in that parliamentary term is much smaller than the male subcorpus, the normalized frequency, which calculates the frequency based on the same number of words in each subcorpus (in our case a million words), shows that the noun is actually five times more frequent in the female subcorpus (249.29) compared to the male one (50.36).", "tags": "", "url": "ch4.html#p-69" },

For a better insight into the phenomenon we perform qualitative analysis by inspecting 50 concordance lines for the five most active male MPs.

{ "title": "Conclusions", "text": "The aim of this tutorial was to demonstrate the potential of linguistic corpora and corpus analysis techniques for the analysis of socio-cultural phenomena and trends observed through language use in specialized discourse. We have shown how methods of corpus linguistics enable quantitative as well as qualitative observations that go beyond the researcher’s intuition, and thus offer greater transparency, objectivity, reliability and replicability, which are also becoming increasingly important in data-driven humanities and social science research.", "tags": "", "url": "ch5.html#p-87" },
{ "title": "Conclusions", "text": "The contribution of this tutorial is three-fold. First, we have demonstrated the importance of understanding the content and structure of a research dataset in order to be able to maximize its potential for our research. Second, we have showcased how a set of standard corpus analysis techniques can be utilized well beyond quantification only and simple corpus queries. Instead, we have systematically used the output provided by the concordancer as a starting point for a detailed qualitative manual analysis that carefully situates the results in the relevant socio-linguistic context. Last but not least, we have situated the tutorial in a real-life research setting, demonstrating the application of common corpus analysis techniques to tackle a set of trending research questions in humanities and social science research.", "tags": "", "url": "ch5.html#p-88" },
{ "title": "Conclusions", "text": "While the tutorial is based on the corpus of Slovenian parliamentary debates, students and scholars are strongly encouraged to replicate the analyses using parliamentary corpora for other languages, thereby contributing to the multilingual, trans-national and trans-cultural comparative research on parliamentary discourse.", "tags": "", "url": "ch5.html#p-89" },
