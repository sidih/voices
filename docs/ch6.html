Slovenia is one of the youngest EU member states and has seen dramatic changes in gender equality in the past 30 years. While in 1986 when Slovenia was still part of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, female MPs represented almost a quarter of all MPs, in 1992 when the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia was convened for the first time, this share notably significantly, so that only in ten MPs was female (<a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Anti%C4%87Gaber.2017" title="Antić Gaber M.

During the transition process, when social, political, economic and value systems changed fundamentally, women in Slovenia lost more of the economic and social gains of socialism than men, and were almost completely ousted from key political institutions. But in the seventh parliamentary term (1/8/2014-21/6/2018), which is the last one included in the siParl 2.0 corpus, female MPs held just over 40% of the seats, largely due to legislative measures enforcing gender quotas. <span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="The share is based on the official number of all female MPs listed in Kustec (2017) and then divided by the number of all MPs (i.e., 90).

Regular speakers are all the speakers in the Parliament who have been explicitly given the floor by the chairperson in charge of the meeting. In this tutorial we only use the category of regular speakers. We intentionally exclude the chairpersons because most of their speeches are regulated by bylaws and other procedures, and are not influenced by their party affiliation, gender or other factors, and would as such skew the results in our particular task.</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e1039"><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Parliamentary term.</span> Each speech in the corpus is categorized into the legislative period in which it was delivered (Term 1 – Term 7).

A notable leap in the representation of women can be observed in the last two terms covered by siParl 2.0, which is most probably due to the adoption of gender quotas, according to which, since 2011, 35% of the candidates must be women (<a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Anti%C4%87Gaber.2017" title="Antić Gaber M.  Selišnik I. (2017). The Slovene version of a fast track to political equality. Teorija in Praksa 54(2) pp. 3373...">Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017</a>). Importantly, despite quotas being one of the most successful measures to increase the number of female MPs (<a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Anti%C4%87Gaber.2017" title="Antić Gaber M.  Selišnik I. (2017). The Slovene version of a fast track to political equality. Teorija in Praksa 54(2) pp. 3373...">Selišnik and Antić Gaber, 2017</a>), our corpus analysis shows a large discrepancy between the number of female speakers and the amount of tokens in their speeches. While election results are easily accessible and frequently used by researchers and analysts, the amount and content of the speeches has been much less readily available and studied much less comprehensively outside corpus linguistics, which is a gap we aim to help close with this tutorial. By looking into the created subcorpora, we can see that for female MPs there is a clear tendency to contribute a lower share of content than would be expected given their share of speakers. This is especially true for Term2 where they produced two times fewer tokens than would correspond to their speaker share. In fact, only in Term4 was women’s contribution marginally greater than their share of seats in the Parliament. Therefore, we can conclude that having more elected female MPs does not directly mean that their voice is more present in the National Assembly. Nonetheless, as the number of female speakers in the Parliament has been on the rise in recent years, the number of their speeches has started increasing as well. From as little as a tenth of all the speeches given in the Parliament during the first five parliamentary terms by female MPs, the contribution of female MPs has risen to almost a third in the last two parliamentary terms covered by our corpus.</p></div></div><div class="subchapter" id="ch6.3"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="head-30">6.3 TASK 2: Issues addressed by women</span></h3><p id="p-52"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-52" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span></a></span>Studies of female political discourse have shown that women tend to debate different topics to men.

(2016)</a>, however, the goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the potential of parliamentary corpora research via concordancers without requiring programming skills, which is why we opt for a two-step manual approach. Moreover, manual approaches are especially appropriate for highly specific topic classification tasks such as ours, for which no pre-trained models or training data exist. It should be noted that both automatic and manual annotation approaches produce errors, but that we can avoid those due to annotator’s subjectivity by employing multiple annotators.

In Term7, the two prevailing female topics not only remained the same but also slightly intensified (58%) while for male MPs the most prominent topic became <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Foreign affairs.</span> While the division of topics between genders cannot be explained through simple corpus analysis, both an intense focus on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Health</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Social affairs</span> in the female subcorpora, as well as the shift from <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Infrastructure</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Public administration</span> to <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Foreign affairs</span> in the male subcorpora are a good reflection of the state of affairs. At the time of independence, the new-born state of Slovenia had to create its own public administration and re-build its infrastructure, which required intensive discussions in the first parliamentary term. The last term, on the other hand, was marked by more intensive international trade as well as greater international security threats, which warranted legislative and budgetary decisions in the parliament. The intensified discussions on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Health issues</span> as well as a continued focus on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Social issues</span> in Term7 were largely due to heavy pressure on the budget due to the severe economic crisis in that period, which also negatively impacted the already crumbling public health system.</p><p id="p-63"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-63" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span></a></span>We can also observe that in Term1, men and women attached similar importance (according to the share of the analysed keywords) to more topics than in Term7 (five shared topics with equal importance in Term1 vs. three topics in Term7). Thus, in Term1, men debated slightly more than women on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Public administration</span> (M: 14% vs. F: 11%), <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Economy and technology</span> (M: 8% vs. F: 6%) and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Justice</span> (M: 2% vs. F: 1%), and women debated slightly more on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Agriculture, forestry and food</span> (M: 3%, F: 4%), while MPs of both genders debated equally on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Defence</span> (1%). In Term7, on the other hand, only three topics appear as equally important to male and female MPs: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Finance</span> (4%), <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Justice</span> (3%) and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Public administration</span> (3%). For a more in-depth analysis, it may be interesting to look into the specific ways (if any) in which female and male MPs approach and discuss the key issues of these topics.</p><p id="p-64"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-64" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span></a></span>The data shows that female-specific topics are <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Education </span>in Term1, and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Health</span>, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Labour, family and social affairs</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Culture</span> in Term7. It is surprising that these last three topics, which are the top three for women, do not appear on the list of topics for men, while we can find the top topics for men (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Infrastructure, Public administration, Foreign affairs</span>) on the women’s list (although with a negligible share of the total). Male-specific topics, on the other hand, are <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Environment</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Interior</span> in both parliamentary terms, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Foreign affairs</span> (in Term1) and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Defence</span> (in Term7). Surprisingly, it can be observed that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Economy and technology</span>, which is a topic present in both terms for both genders, drastically loses its saliency in the subcorpus of female speeches in Term7.</p><p id="p-65"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-65" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span></a></span>Apart from the different areas of interest, the results also show that male and female MPs have different debating styles. In both terms, male MPs use considerably more stylistic words (i.e., clearly colloquial or jargon words observed only from specific speakers) than their female counterparts. In fact, the usage of such words by male MPs tripled in Term7 compared to Term1, which on the one hand indicates the greater casualness of male MPs in general, as well as highlights a change in the debating culture, which in the last two decades has become more ludic and informal. We also observe that ideological words, which tend to be polarizing, are only used by the male MPs. This is in line with findings from the literature, according to which men’s conversational strategies are more aggressive and competitive, whereas women’s debating style is more cooperative (<a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Coates.1997" title="Coates Jennifer. (1997). Women men and language A sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language. London Longman.">Coates, 1997</a>). It should be noted that these results would need to be confirmed by a more detailed analysis, since some recent studies have challenged the clear-cut gender difference in debating styles as being an overgeneralization (cf. <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Ilie.2013" title="Ilie C.

Diachronic comparisons reveal that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Health</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Social issues</span> remain the top priority for female MPs, while the focus of male MPs shifted from <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Infrastructure </span>and<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Public administration </span>towards <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Foreign affairs. </span>In Term1, the most prominent common topic was <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Public administration</span>, while in Term7, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Finance</span> became the most often discussed topic for both male and female MPs. This, however, does not mean that female MPs now debate more on the hard topics, quite the contrary, in fact, as our analysis showed that in Term7 women focused more on soft topics than in Term1.</p></div></div><div class="subchapter" id="ch6.4"><h3><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="head-41">6.4 TASK 3: Topics related to women </span></h3><p id="p-67"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-67" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span></a></span>This task is inspired by related work (see <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Blaxill.2016" title="Blaxill L.

Looking for example at the raw frequencies for Term2 (F: 190; M: 794), we could conclude that male MPs mention the noun “ženska/female” four times more often than their female counterparts. But, because the female subcorpus in that parliamentary term is much smaller than the male subcorpus, the normalized frequency, which calculates the frequency based on the same number of words in each subcorpus (in our case a million words), shows that the noun is actually five times more frequent in the female subcorpus (249.29) compared to the male one (50.36).</p><div id="note-8" class="callout primary"><p id="index-p-d46e1592"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>If you would like to see how to query a subcorpus for the lemma, please watch the screencast on how to extract collocations in NoSketchEngine (min. 00:09–1:24) <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="https://sidih.si/20.500.12325/file2547">here</a>.</p> <video width="420" height="345" controls=""><source src="https://sidih.si/cdn/120/4_EN_collocations.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>

As can be seen from <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="ch6.html#figure11" title="Figure 11 Normalized frequency of mentions of ženskafemale by female and male MPs in siParl 2.0.">Figure 11</a>, female MPs in general tend to talk more about women than their male counterparts. However, if the period between Term2 and Term4 (1996–2008) saw a strong emphasis on topics about women among female MPs in comparison to male MPs, we can observe a steep downward turn in the female subcorpus in more recent terms.</p><p id="p-73"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-73" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span></a></span>The most striking results for the female subcorpus are observed in Term3 and Term5. In Term3, the normalized frequency of the word reached a record high, which might be a consequence of lower numbers of female representatives in the previous two parliamentary terms and their unequal position in society overall. However, as the same trend is observed in the male subcorpus, it appears that other reasons had to contribute to this result as well. For a better insight into the phenomenon we perform qualitative analysis by inspecting 50 concordance lines for the five most active male MPs. They show that legislation regulating specific issues which are particularly linked to women was extensively debated at the time (i.e. legislation related to equal opportunities, artificial insemination with biomedical assistance and quotas). Almost a decade later, in Term5, there was a sudden reduction in the number of mentions of the word in the female subcorpus, which even dropped below the frequency before the year 2000 despite a higher number of female MPs. Term5 coincides with the period of a major global economic crisis, which badly hit Slovenia and probably took centre-stage in parliamentary discussions, but this would need to be confirmed through further investigation and contextualization using qualitative methods, such as concordance analysis.</p><p id="p-74"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-74" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span></a></span>It is also interesting to observe that in Term4 despite there being the second lowest number of female MPs, the noun “ženska/female” remains very frequent as opposed to in Term6 and Term7, when the number of female MPs was considerably higher but the frequencies of the queried word almost two times lower. As previously observed in the overall production of female MPs (see <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="ch6.html#ch6.2.3" title="6.2.3 Comparative analysis">6.2.3</a>), where we found a large discrepancy between the number of female speakers and the amount of words they uttered, these results again show that a higher number of female MPs does not guarantee a strong discussion of issues related to women in the Slovenian Parliament.</p><figure id="figure11"><img class="imageviewer" src="https://sidih.si/iiif/2/entity|1-1000|120|figure11.jpg/full/max/0/default.jpg" data-high-res-src="https://sidih.si/cdn/120/figure11.jpg" alt="Figure 11: Normalized frequency of mentions of “ženska/female” by female and male MPs in siParl 2.0." /><figcaption><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="head"><b></b>Figure 11: Normalized frequency of mentions of “ženska/female” by female and male MPs in siParl 2.0.</figcaption></figcaption></figure><br /><br /></div><div class="subchapter" id="ch6.4.2"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="head-46">6.4.2 Extracting collocations</span></h4><p id="p-75"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-75" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span></a></span>Next, we will demonstrate another popular corpus analysis technique called <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation">collocation extraction</a>, which identifies word combinations that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance based on statistical significance tests.

While window size and minimum frequencies can be set manually and depend on type and frequency of the word under investigation, corpus size, and our research goal, we want to limit our analysis for this tutorial to fixed multi-word expressions, thereby using a very narrow window and strict minimum frequency criteria.</p> <p id="index-p-d46e1666"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>We use the <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/logdice/">logDice</a> statistic measure to measure the association strength between words.

The great majority of the shared collocations (nearly 70%) fall under the first two thematic clusters: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Politics, representation and equality </span>and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Social status and employment</span>, and refer to concepts related to representation of women (e.g., “participacija/participation”), their social status (e.g., “samski/single”) and equality (e.g., “emancipacija/emancipation”).</p><figure id="table8"><img class="imageviewer" src="https://sidih.si/iiif/2/entity|1-1000|120|table8.jpg/full/,600/0/default.jpg" data-high-res-src="https://sidih.si/cdn/120/table8.jpg" alt="Table 8: Frequencies of thematic clusters for the 100 top-ranking collocation candidates in speeches by female and male MPs in all seven parliamentary terms." /><figcaption><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="head"><b></b>Table 8: Frequencies of thematic clusters for the 100 top-ranking collocation candidates in speeches by female and male MPs in all seven parliamentary terms.</figcaption></figcaption></figure><br /><br /><p id="p-84"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-84" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span></a></span>It can also be observed that the female subcorpus contains comparable representation of all but one thematic cluster which together cover almost 60% of the collocations. The only exception is the cluster <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Women’s agency and empowerment</span>. Collocations that belong to this thematic cluster are approximately twice less frequent than collocations belonging to any other cluster. In the male subcorpus, on the other hand, the majority of collocations (61%) fall under only three thematic clusters, namely <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Problems and violence, Politics, representation and equality,</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Women’s agency and empowerment.</span> Furthermore, a detailed look into annotations reveals that men mainly focus on women’s social status (e.g., “poročen/married”) and problems (e.g., “zatiranje/oppression”), as well as their agency and empowerment (e.g., “sposoben/capable”), while not focusing on issues related to women’s employment and health. On the other hand, collocations from the female subcorpus first and foremost refer to health issues (e.g., “zdrav/healthy”) and measures related to help and protection (e.g., “omogočati/enabling”). These are closely followed by words referring to women’s social status (e.g., “izobrazba/education”) and violence (e.g., “posiljen/raped”), which is again contrary to the male subcorpus where more emphasis is given to problems not directly linked to violence (e.g., “poniževanje/humiliation”). In addition, similar to the male subcorpus, employment-related words do not appear in the female subcorpus among the top 100 collocation candidates.</p><p id="p-85"><span><a class="numberParagraphLink" href="#p-85" title="number paragraph link"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span></a></span>These results indicate that female MPs try to address the multitude of issues that women face in various areas of life, from health related issues to the aggression suffered by women and difficulties with entering into politics, while male MPs focus more intensely on the unequal place of women in society and view women as active participants in the process of change. These results also confirm the findings of <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="bibl.html#Anti%C4%87Gaber.2003" title="Antić Gaber M.  Ilonszki G. (2003).

These collocation candidates in the female subcorpus mainly consists of adverbs, followed by prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and numerals, while in the male subcorpus they predominantly include numerals. Similar to what we saw in the keyword analysis (see <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="ch6.html#ch6.3.3" title="6.3.3 Comparative analysis">6.3.3</a>), this once more points to a different debating style of female MPs.
